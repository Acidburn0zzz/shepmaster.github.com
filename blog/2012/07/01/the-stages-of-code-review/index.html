<div class="entry-content"><p>We recently started using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/">gerrit</a> to perform code reviews for
a legacy C codebase that I work on. I also help out on a couple of
newer Java and Ruby projects that have had the benefit of having code
reviews and testing infrastructure from day one.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Starting to use gerrit on our C code has led me to think about how we
approach code reviews, and I&#8217;ve identified some stages that we have
gone through. It&#8217;s loosely sorted by the order in which we adopted
each check. While not every commit needs each point, this is a general
idea of what might be required.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Functionality</p>

<p>This was what started us on the code review path - sometimes we
would commit something that just didn&#8217;t work right. Occasionally,
the code wouldn&#8217;t even compile! To try and address these problems,
we would have a coworker give the code a once-over before pushing
it. We actually started doing this long before gerrit by walking
over to another desk.</p></li>
<li><p>Function names</p>

<p>One of our explicit coding conventions is that non-static functions
must be prefixed with the module name they belong to. This keeps us
sane and helps prevent name collisions. We also have a few
conventions for constructors, destructors and other common
patterns. These are all easy to check for and was something we
started doing almost immediately.</p></li>
<li><p>Resource leaks</p>

<p>After a few annoying memory leaks got committed, we started looking
at the code with a critical eye for all kinds of leaks. Resource
leaks are easy enough to add and subsequently miss, especially in
C. Leaks are really just a special type of non-functioning code,
but one that bites you days/weeks/years later instead of
immediately.</p>

<p>Sometimes we use a tool such as <a href="http://valgrind.org/">valgrind</a> to test for
leaks, but in many cases we just inspect the code visually. We
check to see if resources are handled consistently and pay special
attention to various error conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>Efficiency</p>

<p>For better or worse, we almost always worry about how optimized our
code is. Sometimes this is can be a valuable exercise, but in most
situations it was probably overkill. There&#8217;s just a warm fuzzy
feeling when you catch an O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithm that could be
O(n log n), even if you spend more time coming up with the faster
algorithm than will ever be saved in runtime. Since this focus on
optimization is part of our culture, it has found it&#8217;s way into our
reviews.</p></li>
<li><p>Tests</p>

<p>Tests fall lower on this list than I would prefer. Unit testing C
code is, at best, hard and/or annoying. Add the fact that trying to
test code that was never designed to be tested is painful, and you
can easily see why we tend to turn a blind eye when a commit
doesn&#8217;t add any new tests.</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation</p>

<p>Code written in C should probably have more documentation than most
other languages, simply due to all the ways you can shoot yourself
in the foot. For example, you can&#8217;t tell if any given function will
take ownership of the pointer you pass it, that information has to
be documented somewhere. When we prefix our function names with the
module name, the descriptive part of the name is often shortened to
prevent extremely long function names. This means the function
documentation is vital to understand what the function does.</p>

<p>Reviewing documentation often comes down to checking that it makes
sense and is proper English. It&#8217;s impressive how mangled a sentence
can get when you refactor the code it is trying to describe.</p></li>
<li><p>Coding style</p>

<p>Many different aspects of code fall into &#8220;style&#8221;: the contents,
formatting and spelling of comments; the names of variables, static
functions, and structures; the size and complexity of functions;
the contents of structures.</p>

<p>These stylistic issues can be difficult to talk about in a code
review, since sometimes it comes down to personal preference. The
best you can do is express your preference and try to sway the
other developer to your line of thinking. It helps if both people
realize that the code has to be read and maintained by the entire
development group.</p></li>
<li><p>Test style</p>

<p>Test code style is an entirely different kettle of fish from
production code style. A test needs to focus on how a user would
want to use the code. It should minimize the clutter required to
perform the test so as to make the test as readable as possible,
while still highlighting the interesting part under test.</p>

<p>Similar to code style, the difficulty reviewing tests comes from
differences in personal preference. This is compounded by the fact
that we are not as experienced with writing great tests yet.</p></li>
<li><p>Commit message</p>

<p>Right now, this is my holy grail of code reviews. I once spent 15
minutes skimming through the git log to determine if we had a
preferred <em>verb tense</em> in our commit messages (we did). More
reasonably, this can involve ensuring that commit messages are
capitalized consistently and that they describe why a change is
being made, not just what or how.</p></li>
</ol>


<h4>Where we are now</h4>

<p>The C project is currently somewhere around the &#8220;Tests&#8221; or
&#8220;Documentation&#8221; stages. The Java and Ruby projects expect tests and
documentation, so they hover around the &#8220;Code style&#8221; and &#8220;Test style&#8221;
stages; I&#8217;ve only had one or two opportunities to correct someones
verb tense :-).</p>
