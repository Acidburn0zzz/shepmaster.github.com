<div class="entry-content"><p>At work, we&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">Capybara</a> and
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/">Selenium</a> to test our newest web application. Many of us
have used this combination before for our own projects, but it&rsquo;s new
territory for a work project.</p>

<p>Every so often, we would get this error from a specific test:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Selenium::WebDriver::Error::StaleElementReferenceError:
</span><span class='line'>  Element not found in the cache - perhaps the page has changed since it was looked up</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The error was intermittent, so we fell into the seductive but
dangerous trap of simply rerunning our tests whenever it
failed. Recently, I had a bit of time and decided to dig into it and
fix it once and for all.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>My first task was to see if I could reproduce the error locally. We
often saw the error when running the tests on our <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a>
continuous integration server, so there was the possibility that the
problem was environmental. However, we also knew that the failure was
intermittent, so we couldn&rsquo;t be sure it was environmental even if the
test passed locally a few times.</p>

<p>I rigged up a small shell script to simply run the test over and over
again while I wandered away from my computer. The script looked
something like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span> (test-script-runner.sh)</span> <a href='/downloads/code/test-script-runner.sh'>download</a></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">set</span> -eu
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">failures</span><span class="o">=</span>0
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">for </span>run in <span class="sb">`</span>seq 20<span class="sb">`</span>; <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">    if</span> ! rspec -e <span class="s1">&#39;the bad test&#39;</span>; <span class="k">then</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">        </span><span class="nv">failures</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$((</span><span class="nv">$failures</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="k">))</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">fi</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">    </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Test run $run complete, $failures failures&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">done</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a proper statistical manner to determine how many
times the test would have to be run without failing to be reasonably
certain that the test won&rsquo;t fail, but I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about
that &ndash; the test failed somewhere within the first ten or so runs.</p>

<p>Now that I knew the test could fail on my local setup, it was time to
dig into what the test was doing. The test was fairly concise and
readable (which I highly appreciated) and looked something like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">it</span> <span class="s1">&#39;deletes the element&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:js</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">true</span>  <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">visit</span> <span class="n">path_to_the_page</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">click_on</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Remove item&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">page</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">should_not</span> <span class="n">have_css</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;.item&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">text</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Old text&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The exception was coming from line #4 &ndash; when the test made the first
assertion about the elements. Unfortunately, the stacktrace isn&rsquo;t very
useful, as it mostly contains references to the JavaScript running
inside of Firefox. The exception text indicates that the test has a
reference to an element, but it isn&rsquo;t available in the cache
anymore. Considering that the test just deleted the element, this is
certainly suspicious.</p>

<p>At this point, I cloned the capybara repository and started poking
around. A <code>git grep</code> quickly found where <code>has_no_css?</code> was
<a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/blob/1.1_stable/lib/capybara/node/matchers.rb#L171">defined</a>. Following the thread of code led to
<code>has_no_selector?</code>, which calls the <code>all</code> <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/blob/1.1_stable/lib/capybara/node/finders.rb#L109">method</a>. This method
had a pretty clear split between the &ldquo;finding&rdquo; part of the code and
the &ldquo;filtering&rdquo; part. There was no magic I used here to see this, just
previous experience debugging race conditions.</p>

<p>I opened up the installed gem and inserted a sleep directly into the
code between the &ldquo;finding&rdquo; and &ldquo;filtering&rdquo; sections. It&rsquo;s ugly doing
this, but it&rsquo;s good to try to not change too many things at once when
debugging. I played with the sleep value a bit and eventually found a
value that reliably reproduced the failure. Success!</p>

<p>Well, maybe not <em>complete</em> success, but at least a step in the right
direction. Even though I could reproduce the problem, I had only
reproduced it in our production application, and I had modified my
installed gem directly. It was time to make a nice test case.</p>

<p>I created a new Rails app and added the requisite RSpec gems. Since we
only need a simple HTML page with a bit of JavaScript to remove the
element, I modified the index.html that ships with Rails to have the
JavaScript inline and created an element and link to wire the action
to.</p>

<p>Since I knew that I would want to make changes to Capybara, I used the
<code>:path</code> parameter in the Gemfile to point to my local checkout of
Capybara. This is an awesome feature of <a href="http://gembundler.com/">Bundler</a> that you might not
know about. It also means I&rsquo;m not messing with my generally-available
copy of Capybara, which is good for my sanity.</p>

<p>I then created a stripped-down version of the test, the same as the
example above. After getting everything hooked up, I ran the test but
it didn&rsquo;t fail. This was bad news &ndash; I had done a few big steps between
the production app and the smaller test case &ndash; which one of them could
have changed the behavior?</p>

<p>This is where my knowledge of our production system came in useful. In
that application, we aren&rsquo;t just removing something from the page, we
are persisting that deletion to disk. Doing that can add some time
before the JavaScript fires to remove the item. I changed the test
JavaScript to have a delay less than the delay in Capybara and ran the
test again. It failed, just like we wanted it to. To be sure, I ran
the test case a bunch of times to make sure it always failed and for
the expected reason. Success!</p>

<p>Well, almost. Even though I had a test case, I still needed to show
that code to someone who could do something about it. Checking back at
the <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">Capybara website</a>, I looked for how to submit a
ticket. Right at the top is a nice, clear comment:</p>

<blockquote><p>Need help? Ask on the mailing list (please do not open an issue on GitHub)</p></blockquote>

<p>So, I pushed my changes to Capybara to <a href="https://github.com/shepmaster/capybara">my fork</a> and
updated my test app to use a remote git version of the gem (another
cool Bundler feature). I then pushed <a href="https://github.com/shepmaster/capybara-race">my test case</a> to
GitHub as well. I took a bit of time to create a short README so that
anyone stumbling on the test app would have a clue as to what it was.</p>

<p>After that, it was just a small matter to write up a clear email to
the Capybara list. I still find emailing new lists scary. Who knows
how the list will respond? This time I got a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/ruby-capybara/O3Ib6INOP58">nice surprise</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>That&rsquo;s a very nice bug report, Jake.</p>

<p>It appears to be a bug indeed. I&rsquo;ve been able to reproduce it on master as well.</p></blockquote>

<p>A GitHub issue <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/issues/843">has been opened</a>, and the bug is well on the
way to being fixed. Yay for Open Source!</p>
