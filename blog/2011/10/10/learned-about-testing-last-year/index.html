<div class="entry-content"><p>Over the last year or so, I&#8217;ve been trying to learn about various
types and methodologies of testing. The Ruby community is pretty vocal
about testing, so I felt out of place not knowing even the most basic
of things. This post is intended to organize my current thoughts and
hopefully provide some guidance for people on the same journey.</p>

<h2>Who should read this?</h2>

<p>I had to realize two things before I could start learning:</p>

<ol>
<li>I don&#8217;t know enough about testing.</li>
<li>I need to know more about testing.</li>
</ol>


<p>If you don&#8217;t fit into both of these categories, you probably aren&#8217;t
reading this post.</p>

<p>If you know what &#8220;mockist&#8221; and &#8220;classicist&#8221; mean and you know which
you are, you probably already know everything here. If you care, I
generally take the &#8220;mockist&#8221; approach, and this post reflects that.</p>

<p>Otherwise, feel free to continue!</p>

<h2>Why should I test?</h2>

<p>The simplest answer is that testing allows you to have some degree of
confidence that the code as written is right.</p>

<p>Less obvious is the fact that tests give you confidence to change
code. Eventually, some part of the software will need to change
while everything else should stay constant. For me, this point really
hit home when I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131177052/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakgousblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0131177052">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a> by Michael Feathers. I deal with lots of code that
needs to be changed and I&#8217;m usually worried that my change might
affect some conceptually remote piece of the software.</p>

<p>Maybe the hardest thing for people to believe is that tests can
provide feedback on the design of the code. This is a core concept
behind Test-Driven Design: if you listen to what your tests tell you
about your code, you can make your code better.</p>

<p>Note that these three things cover the entire life cycle of code;
correctness applies to the <em>present</em> of the feature, confidence comes
into play when the feature is in the <em>past</em>, and design feedback sheds
light into the <em>future</em> of your code.</p>

<h2>What flavors of test exist?</h2>

<p>Here is a list of the types of tests that I can think of purely off the top
of my head, I&#8217;m sure there are lots more.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">Unit testing</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing">Integration testing</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing">Functional testing</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing">Acceptance testing</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_testing">Load testing</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_testing">Performance testing</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing">Fuzz testing</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Those are all links to corresponding Wikipedia page; I don&#8217;t agree
with every nuance listed on those pages, and some pages are
unfortunately short, but the links provide the barest minimum of
a start if you would like to learn more about each type of test.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t tend to draw a hard line between integration, functional, and
acceptance tests. If you need to know the difference, this
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4904096/whats-the-difference-between-unit-functional-acceptance-and-integration-tests">Stack Overflow question</a> has a pretty good breakdown. I
think of acceptance tests as a superset of functional tests, which
are themselves supersets of integration tests.</p>

<p>All I care to talk about in this post are unit and acceptance tests. I
am <em>not</em> saying the other types of testing are not important. I am
saying that I think that unit and acceptance tests are the most
useful types of tests to start with.</p>

<p>I am nominally a programmer, and this post will exhibit that
bias. I certainly hope that people approaching testing from a
different angle can benefit from this post, but no guarantees are
made.</p>

<h2>How do acceptance and unit tests fit together?</h2>

<p>A great way to understand how acceptance and unit tests work in
concert is to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356379/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakgousblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=1934356379">The RSpec Book</a>. If you are too lazy
and/or cheap to read it, here&#8217;s one extremely salient picture:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/bdd-cycle.png" alt="The BDD test/develop cycle" /></p>

<p>The extremely abridged version is that you write an <strong>acceptance
test</strong> for the feature you want. This test should be written from the
point-of-view of the user and using terms that a user would use.</p>

<p>As you try to make the acceptance test pass, you will realize that you
need to write smaller components to solve the larger problem. In an
object-oriented language, these components will probably be
objects. The test for each component is a <strong>unit test</strong>.</p>

<h2>Acceptance tests</h2>

<p>Acceptance tests tell you that the software as a whole does what it is
supposed to do. It&#8217;s important to write acceptance tests as if you
were the user. This makes it so that the test exposes the actual
<em>value</em> of the code, explaining <em>why</em> the code even exists.</p>

<p>To write proper acceptance tests, you need to have complete control
over the entire environment your software runs in. If you interact
with a database, you must be able to change data in the database. If
you need to be able to parse an empty RSS feed, then you must be able
to create an empty RSS feed to test that functionality.</p>

<p>Because acceptance tests exercise the entire system, it&#8217;s very easy
for them to be slow, but there are a few techniques that you can use
to help keep your total time down.</p>

<p>Acceptance tests should cover the &#8220;happy path&#8221; of your software. If
there are any extremely important failure cases, then cover those with
acceptance tests as well. However, you don&#8217;t need to cover every
possible case. For example, use unit tests to ensure that things that
generate errors do so consistently, and then use one acceptance test
to make sure errors are shown correctly.</p>

<p>Make sure that you minimize what data you need for an acceptance
test. You probably don&#8217;t need to load 10,000 rows into your database
just to make sure that a user can view their profile. Use the smallest
amount of data you can get away with.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get lazy and reuse one giant piece of setup code for every
test. This is an example of the tests telling you that your design is
painful to use. In this case, a user would have to duplicate all of
the steps in the setup in order to use the function you are
testing. Maybe that&#8217;s the way it has to be, but try to make it
easier on the user.</p>

<h2>Unit tests</h2>

<p>Unit tests have some exciting qualities for a developer. Generally,
unit tests are <em>fast</em> and can isolate exactly the one thing that is
broken. Achieving these goals takes hard work.</p>

<p>Limiting each unit test to one assertion enables isolation of
faults. If a test fails, the name of the test by itself should serve
to tell you exactly what went wrong. If you have multiple assertions,
then you have to look at the failing line number to determine the real
issue.</p>

<h3>Mock objects</h3>

<p>One way to achieve isolation and speed in your unit tests is to
introduce <em>mock objects</em>. Mock objects are <em>test doubles</em> that
surround the real code under test and assert on the messages sent
between objects. Since they aren&#8217;t real objects, they can&#8217;t affect
your test correctness, and they are extremely lightweight so they will
be fast.</p>

<p>Seems easy to use mocks, right? Just create some dummy objects that
responds to the necessary methods and returns values as needed. Then
point the object under test at the mock objects, run the code, and
assert that tested object has used any returned values correctly.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an example of doing that in Ruby. I&#8217;m eschewing using any
libraries in an attempt to make the code as obvious as possible.</p>

<p>Sorry, I lied to you; that last example was <em>not</em> a mock - although I
thought it was for the longest time. The double shown is actually a
<em>stub</em>. The key point is that a mock <strong>asserts messages are
sent</strong>. The example above asserts a state.</p>

<p>Here is a test that correctly uses a mock:</p>

<p>This last example uses a mock to assert that the right messages were
sent. Note that we removed the <code>foo</code> accessor from the first class; we
don&#8217;t need it anymore! The state of the object is now kept where it
should be - inside the object.</p>

<p>The difference between stubs and mocks can seem subtle, but it is
important. For a much richer discussion, read <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">Mocks Aren&#8217;t Stubs</a> by Martin Fowler.</p>

<p>I make no claim that this example is a <em>good</em> use of mocks, just that
it is how mocks are to be used.</p>

<h3>Object-oriented programming and mocks</h3>

<p>This is all recent information that started to worm its way into my
brain after watching <a href="http://confreaks.net/videos/659-rubyconf2011-why-you-don-t-get-mock-objects">Why You Don&#8217;t Get Mock Objects</a>
- you should watch it too.</p>

<p>The code example above may still have a problem. The <code>Foo</code> object asks
the <code>Bar</code> object for the value of <code>quux</code> and then manipulates the
result. This goes against the <a href="http://pragprog.com/articles/tell-dont-ask">Tell, Don&#8217;t Ask</a> principle, and
could be a warning sign of <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FeatureEnvySmell">Feature Envy</a>.</p>

<p>You should only mock collaborators. Collaborators are objects that are
peers of the object under test. Collaborators should not be confused
with objects that simply serve as implementation details. If you store
a bit of state in a string or some integers, those are internal
details and should not be mocked out.</p>

<h3>Example of applying these ideas to real code</h3>

<p>This is a real (but anonymized) feature and test example. We have a
piece of code that manipulates data retrieved via HTTP. This retrieval
can be fairly expensive, so we want to cache the final manipulated
result. The code that does the manipulation and caching is separated
from the HTTP call by a few intermediate objects.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/mock-example-current.png" alt="The current code setup" /></p>

<p>Our current testing strategy is to provide fake data at the end of the
chain, effectively short-circuiting the HTTP call. We also count the
number of times that the HTTP call is made, and the test fails if the
call is made more than once.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/mock-example-current-test.png" alt="The current test setup" /></p>

<p>One obvious downside is that if <em>any</em> of the intermediate objects
decide they need to make an HTTP call themselves, our test will
fail. What&#8217;s worse is that the failure will seem to indicate that the
caching is not working, so we will start debugging there. When we
finally figure out that the test is &#8220;lying&#8221; to us, we will have wasted
time and started to distrust our tests.</p>

<p>We can make the test better if we move the test double closer to the
code under test. This lets us ignore all the other objects in the call
chain - if one of these other objects does not behave properly, this
test will not fail. This is no free lunch; there <strong>must</strong> be unit
tests that focus on the other objects so you can tell when they break!</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/mock-example-next-test.png" alt="A better test setup" /></p>

<p>While writing the caching tests, we should notice that there are two
sets of unrelated tests: one that checks that the core functionality
works, and one that checks that the caching works. This should
influence us to split the object apart (better known as the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">Single Responsibility Principle</a>).</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/mock-example-srp.png" alt="A better code setup" /></p>

<p>Splitting the caching into a separate object will allow us to test the
caching behavior in isolation.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/mock-example-srp-test.png" alt="Even better test setup" /></p>

<h2>A handful of things to learn next</h2>

<p>My learning isn&#8217;t over, and hopefully never will be. Here is a sample
of some questions currently percolating in my brain.</p>

<p>Acceptance tests are often slow because they hit an external
resource. Ruby has a gem called <a href="https://github.com/myronmarston/vcr">VCR</a> (and Java has a clone
called <a href="https://github.com/robfletcher/betamax">Betamax</a>) that record HTTP requests and responses and
then play them back during subsequent test runs. By definition, using
one of these tools means you are no longer always doing true
integration tests. However, the speedup is usually noticeable.</p>

<ul>
<li>When should you use this type of tool?</li>
<li>What are the positives and negatives of this kind of tool?</li>
<li>How frequently do you clear the cache of saved responses?</li>
<li>Can the concept be easily extended to non-HTTP protocols?</li>
</ul>


<p>Ideally, you should never add code simply to make something
testable. At that point, you are adding complexity to a system that
will not benefit from that complexity. My pragmatic side says that
sometimes you have to add hooks only to be used for testing.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you really need to add these hooks?</li>
<li>Is there a general type of design that avoids the need for the
hooks?</li>
<li>Is adding this kind of hook worth it?</li>
</ul>


<h2>Things you should read or watch</h2>

<p>Although the book seems like it will only be about Ruby, it actually
covers the concepts of testing thoroughly. Introduced me to the
{acceptance,unit}-test cycle. Also contains practical information if
you will be testing in Ruby.</p>

<h5><a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">Mocks Aren&#8217;t Stubs</a> (article)</h5>

<p>Provides an overview of terms used as well as examples to help
separate the different concepts (in Java, but don&#8217;t be
scared). Defines &#8220;classicist&#8221; and &#8220;mockist&#8221;; you don&#8217;t need to pick
one or the other, but understanding them is vital.</p>

<h5><a href="http://confreaks.net/videos/659-rubyconf2011-why-you-don-t-get-mock-objects">Why You Don&#8217;t Get Mock Objects</a> (video)</h5>

<p>Session from RubyConf 2011 that started to clarify certain aspects of
mocking and testing. Gregory Moeck also introduced me to the term
&#8220;secondary teacher&#8221;.</p>

<h5><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321503627/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakgousblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0321503627">Growing Object-Oriented Software</a> (book)</h5>

<p>On my list of books to order and read. I used to think that I
understood Object-Oriented Programming, but recent developments have
changed that belief.  I hope that reading this can help guide me to a
better understanding.</p>

<h5><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131177052/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakgousblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0131177052">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a> (book)</h5>

<p>Excellent information about how to take legacy code (defined as code
without tests) and make it non-legacy. Clarified how tests let you be
confident about changes. Provides heaps of practical advice.</p>

<h2>Tell me what I&#8217;ve said wrong</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m certain that I&#8217;ve said something that someone will disagree
with. If you&#8217;d care to correct my false ideas, feel free to contact me
via Twitter. If you think it will take longer than a tweet, create a
blog post and let me know about it!</p>
