<div class="entry-content"><p>At work, we are embarking on a grand new project, one that promises to
involve quite a few engineers and take a good chunk of time. It is the
quintessential <strong>Next Big Thing</strong>. So far, one or two
prototypes of the new product have been developed (and demonstrated
with positive feedback), but now it is time to <em>really</em> get our
hands dirty.</p>

<p>Of course, by &#8220;hands dirty&#8221;, I mean that it is time to generate reams
and reams of project plans and software designs, both of which will
take an inordinate amount of time to create and then be underused and
under-maintained. One old friend that popped up during project
planning was the ever-popular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart">Gantt chart</a>.</p>

<h2>A simple Gantt chart</h2>

<p>If you are unacquainted with Gantt charts, they are pretty
straight-forward (as far as I have been able to determine). Gantt
charts show how multiple components of a project can be scheduled
together, accounting for dependencies between tasks as well as how
long those tasks are expected to take.</p>

<div class="image_with_caption">
  <img src="/images/blog/gantt-1.png" alt="simple Gantt chart" />
  <span>A very simple Gantt chart</span>
</div>


<p>As you see, each step requires completion of <strong>all</strong> previous steps
before you can start on the next step. In this case, the project can
be done in seven weeks (the <em>critical path</em>). Obviously, this is a
highly simplified example, and bears no relation to reality,
especially as I completely made it up. However, the astute reader can
see how real-world projects might be coerced into Gantt chart form.</p>

<h2>Mock objects to the rescue</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">Mock objects</a> are simple pieces of code that stand in for other
pieces of code. The most common times I have used a mock object has
been when the real object is too complicated or slow to use in a
test. However, there are other cases when they can be used, such as
when the real object &#8220;does not yet exist or may change behavior&#8221;.</p>

<div class="image_with_caption">
  <img src="/images/blog/gantt-2.png" alt="Gantt chart using mock objects" />
  <span>Previous Gantt chart modified to fully leverage mock objects</span>
</div>


<p>The heavy-handed dependencies of the first chart are gone, replaced by
time to create suitable mock objects for the application logic and UI
teams (represented by the gradients at left). For example purposes, I
hand-wavingly say that creating these objects will take one week for
each team. In addition, there is an extra week of &#8220;integration&#8221; after
each team thinks they are done.</p>

<p>If this reorganization is to be believed, then we have reduced the
time from start to finish for the project from seven weeks down to
four. Obviously, this will save millions of dollars and allow the
product to get to market that much faster.</p>

<h3>Integration</h3>

<p>Depending on how your teams work together, an after-the-fact
integration step may or may not be needed. If each team works
completely in isolation, then you will probably need a sizable chunk
of time to make sure all the pieces fit together correctly. If your
teams communicate and work together, then most thorny integration
needs will have been hammered out along the way, and time spent purely
on integration could be reduced.</p>

<p>In addition, if your teams <em>have</em> been working together, the
interfaces between components are probably more ideal than if each
group had developed sequentially. As the UI team realizes they need
lower-level support to complete some feature, they can add that
functionality to a mock object on-demand. In return, the application
team can then look at the created mock objects to know exactly what
interface and functionality is required, without worrying that they
are writing code that won&#8217;t be used.</p>

<h3>Not a panacea</h3>

<p>Of course, mock objects are not a development silver bullet.</p>

<p><strong>You need to be able to take advantage of the parallelization.</strong> If
you only have one team or just one developer, it&#8217;s safe to say you
wont see any time benefit from this process. For the moment, I am
ignoring any additional benefits that mock objects might bring, such
as reduction in testing or debugging time.</p>

<p><strong>The total amount of development time is greater.</strong> The cumulative
time for the sequential method is seven developer-weeks, but the
parallel method takes ten developer-weeks. The counterargument here is
that the start-to-finish time is less and your developer efficiency is
much higher. If you have two teams sitting idle at any given time, you
only have an efficiency of 33%. If everyone is working at the same
time, the efficiency will be closer to 100%. This assumes that working
100% of the time is a good thing, which is debatable.</p>

<p><strong>Teams in the middle of the dependency graph need to interact with
other groups more.</strong> In the example above, the application logic team
will need to communicate with both the database and UI teams, which
can reduce the time available to work on the actual application
logic. Even if you develop sequentially, this time still needs to be
spent: when the application logic team is using the database, and then
again when the UI team is using the application logic. The difference
when working in parallel is that the time required is more obvious and
the teams still view the code as mutable.</p>

<p><strong>The programmers on each team need to be competent.</strong> This means they
need to be able to think one abstraction level up and down, at a
minimum. Your UI team has to be able to think similar to the
application logic team sometimes, and the application logic team has
to think like the UI team sometimes. Otherwise, the created mock
objects could be completely fictional and impossible to create. If
your developers do not meet this condition, you have bigger
problems. Developers should always be aware of what goes on around
them, and ideally everyone aims to be a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=461505383919">full-stack</a>
developer.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Allows parallelization of &#8220;dependent&#8221; tasks</li>
<li>Create more ideal interfaces</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Potential problems</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Requires multiple teams that can work in parallel</li>
<li>Total amount of work increases</li>
<li>Teams in the middle must interact more</li>
<li>Requires competent programmers</li>
</ul>


<h2>A note to the terminology-minded</h2>

<p>I use the term &#8220;mock object&#8221; interchangeably with the more generic
term &#8220;test double&#8221;. Martin Fowler has an <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">excellent
article</a> that details some of the differences between different
types of test doubles. Any type of test double should be able to help
break the dependency chain; it is up to each team to decide which
double is appropriate for a given situation.</p>

<h2>Community feedback</h2>

<p><strong>EDIT 3:42 PM</strong> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2268686">Groxx</a> over at Hacker News points out that I
am unfairly attacking the Gantt chart itself, and that realistically
the problem is one of &#8220;organizational abuse&#8221;. In addition, the Gantt
chart is quite capable of handling my second example. In my
experience, most Gantt charts have looked more like my first
example, so I tend to conflate the chart with the act of
serialization of tasks.</p>

<p>My real point is that project planning often devolves into the concept
of &#8220;we must code A before B before C&#8221;, but that by using techniques
such as mock objects, we can break the (artificial) dependency graph.</p>
